	setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/ram0 ip=dhcp console=ttyS0,115200 ramdisk_size=16384'
	tftp 08200000 vmlinux.img
	tftp 08400000 initrd.img
	bootm 08200000 08400000'

Starting and testing the Webserver on the ECP250:
	boot the board and look for the IP-Config line:
	===
	...
	IP-Config: Got DHCP answer from 0.0.0.0, my address is W.X.Y.Z
	...
	lm32_eval_ecp250 login:
	===
	now login with username "root" and password "lattice"
	then start the script ./http_server.sh
	===
	BusyBox v1.7.1 (2007-11-16 15:06:32 CET) built-in shell (msh)
	Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

	root:~# ./http_server.sh
	===
	The Webserver can now be reached at http://W.X.Y.Z/
	The Webserver CGI and LED driver Demo can be reached at
	http://W.X.Y.Z/cgi-bin/lm32_leds.cgi

Starting and testing telnet on the ECP250:
	Use a telnet client (telnet/hyperterminal) with the IP-Address W.X.Y.Z
	and the login root/lattice.

Starting and testing telnet on the ECP250:
	The ftp server is up and running on IP-Address W.X.Y.Z.
	Using the login root/lattice the home directory containing the script
	http_server.sh can be fetched from the board.
