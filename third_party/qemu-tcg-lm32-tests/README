How to obtain new binaries:

1) Install a lm32 toolchain

On Arch Linux, which is what I'm using, I suggest installing the following packages
* base-devel
* git
* lm32-elf-gcc
* lm32-elf-binutils
* lm32-elf-newlib


2) Clone the qemu-jslm32 repository and compile everything
$ git clone https://github.com/ubercomp/qemu-jslm32/
$ cd qemu-jslm32/tests/tcg/lm32
$ make

3) Copy everything here
cp *.bin $PATH_TO_THIS_DIRECTORY
